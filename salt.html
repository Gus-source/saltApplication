              <p>I recently discovered a passion for coding I didn't think existed. It pushes me to learn and experiment for the most part of each day and time flies. Usually, around being stuck. When that happens, not only do I lose track of time, but also meals and when to sleep. Being stuck should be annoying, but it's really inspiring, even slightly addictive to be honest. Maybe because one of the most rewarding things in life is figuring things out, being creative.</p>

              <p>Quite a few ideas are floating in my head to improve certain user experiences. The opportunity to possibly discuss them in a team, maybe even take them on as a team challenge, would be awesome. Team creativity is a vibrant setting for growth in any learning environment and a complement within this program that I'm already looking forward to, if I get accepted. As I'm sure you notice by my overly clear coding attempt of this page, I'm far from an expert. Therefore, I'm determined to stay humble and embrace everything the right training has to offer, including all participants, should I get the chance.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, I strongly believe in the concept of education to match society's need. This method should be applied to more fields, even implemented within the school system in my opinion. It's probably the most effective, relevant and beneficial road to a job there is, for all parties involved. I have no doubt that this program will be tough, but I'm prepared and highly motivated to do whatever it takes to acquire the right skills. If that means staying late after class to keep focusing on an issue, postponing the occasional dinner, or sacrifying social life, so be it. Dedication will see me through.</p>
