                  <h2>Welcome!</h2>

                  <p>Thank you for viewing my application.</p>

                  <p>About 8 weeks ago I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS and currently, I'm trying to learn JavaScript. Prior to that, they were only familiar by name.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to visually present what I'm capable of at this point, hence the GitHub upload. Perhaps it simplifies identifying the level I'm on and whether it's enough to be admitted to your training.</p>

                  <p>Putting together some of this content has been challenging. Lots of experimenting and figuring out mistakes, but I think I'm progressing, not least, having lots of fun doing it. It's pedal to the metal, 10-12 hs per day, figuring out how to code.</p>

                  <p><a href="code.html">Here are a couple of examples.</a></p>
